        Cricket is a popular bat-and-ball sport that originated in England and
        has since spread across the world, particularly to countries like India,
        Australia, Pakistan, and South Africa. The game is played between two
        teams, each consisting of eleven players, on a large oval field. The
        primary objective is to score runs by hitting the ball, which is bowled
        by the opposing team’s bowlers, while the batting team aims to defend
        their wickets. A match typically consists of various formats, including
        Test matches (lasting up to five days), One Day Internationals (50 overs
        per side), and Twenty20 matches (20 overs per side), each with its own
        unique pace and strategy. The game is known for its rich history,
        complex rules, and strategic games.

        Cricket’s appeal lies not only in the competition but also in the
        camaraderie it fosters among players and fans. A key aspect of cricket
        is the balance between batting and bowling, where each team’s success
        depends on skillful execution and timely performances. Legendary
        cricketers, like Sachin Tendulkar, Sir Donald Bradman, and Virat Kohli,
        have become household names, inspiring generations to play and watch the
        sport. With its global fan base, cricket continues to evolve, blending
        tradition with modern innovations such as technology-assisted umpiring
        and T20 leagues, which have enhanced the sport's entertainment value.
